<h2>NBA Analysis Capstone Project</h2>
Our goal is to build a machine learning model that can (with reasonable accuracy) predict whether said player will make the NBA playoffs based a variety of factors such as: of what team said player is on, individual player stats, team composition, etc (see image below). We picked this topic because we believe that it would be interesting if we can predict the success of a player within the NBA based off of their statistics.<br><br>

<li>Team Structure: Jack = machine learning mockup (triangle), Dorian = GitHub repository/visualizations (square), Ari - database (circle)</li>
<li>Communication protocol - we are communicating via Slack and have scheduled biweekly meetings during classtime.</li>
<li>Data used: we are using a NBA player statistics dataset downloaded from Kaggle.</li>
